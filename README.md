# heart-failure-mortality-prediction
This project predicts the risk of death (mortality) in heart failure patients using machine learning. It includes full Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and model building using Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
🚀 Project Overview

Heart failure is a major clinical condition worldwide. Using patient clinical features, this project aims to:

Analyze patterns in the dataset

Identify important factors associated with mortality

Build predictive models

Compare model performance

Visualize clinical insights

📂 Dataset

The dataset contains 299 patient records with 12 clinical features such as:

Age

Serum creatinine

Ejection fraction

High blood pressure

Anaemia

Diabetes

Smoking

Platelets

Creatinine phosphokinase

…and the target variable DEATH_EVENT
